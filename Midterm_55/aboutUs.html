        <p class="card-text">Hi, my name is Andrew McMahon, and I'm a current Sophomore in Software Engineering at Iowa State University. Along with my partner Qusai, we created a simple webpage for the S E/COM S 319 Midterm project, which takes JSON data containing product information, which is then read by a Javascript file, and then finally put into a HTML file using a src tag. If you have any questions about the site, feel free to email me <a href="mailto: mcmahon4@iastate.edu? subject= subject text">here!</a> This project was finalized and completed on March 12th, 2023.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hi! I'm Quasi Elwazir, and I am also a current Sophomore in Software Engineering at Iowa State University. For the website, we used some aspects from our Assignment 01, but made significant personal changes to where the site looks almost unreconizable in comparison; this is mainly due to most of the code being in card elements in the Javascript files. This website was made for the Midterm Project of S E/COM S 319 at Iowa State. If you have any questions regarding the site, or anything else, feel free to <a href="mailto: qusaie25@iastate.edu? subject= subject text">email me!</p>
